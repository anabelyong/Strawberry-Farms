# Optimization Model for Strawberry Farms
1) Used XPress Mathematical Programming systems as a means of modelling a case study. 
2) Explored of the modelling language Mosel to define index sets, data arrays, decision variables, constraints, solve LP problems, analyse problem sensitivity and report the results in a suitable format for further processing using Excel.
3) READ StrawberryFieldsReport.pdf to gain a better understanding of the code we have executed and the purpose of this optimization model.
